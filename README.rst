I Just Felt Like Running
========================

`This <just-felt-like-running.ipynb>`_ is just a notebook taking a look at the
data from a 365-day run streak I did April 2017 to April 2018.

You can launch the notebook interactively on Binder:

Or you can grab the repository and set up a conda environment to run things
locally::

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ conda activate gpx
    $ jupyter notebook
